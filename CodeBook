##Variables in tidyData

*SubjectLabel
  *Numbers 1-30 that signify unique volunteer subjects
* Tidy Data Rationale: There are two ways to format the tidy data: by Subject or by Activity. I choose to lead by 
Subject, whereby relationships between activities with the same subject are immediately apparent. However, through 
further data manipulation the data can be structed to lead with Activity.*
*ActivityLabel
    * One of six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) that the 
    Samsung data were collected
*Body Acceleration, Gravity Acceleration, Body Gyro etc. means and standard deviations
